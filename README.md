# Case Study for Target Recruiting

**During the development of this case study I made the following assumptions:**

1. Target Recruiting expects to be able to change selections at any level of the dropdown hierarchy and have the experience update by correctly clearing downstream selections and populating new options.
2. Target Recruiting expected selections to be embeded in URL params to allow navigation through choices using browser buttons in addition to allowing a specific param combo to render the correct selections and data.
3. Target Recruiting expected a demonstration of ability and familiarity with testing tech and practices but not necessarily a certain level of code coverage.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
